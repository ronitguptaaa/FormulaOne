# Formula One - ETL Project


## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the complete Formula One (F1) dataset spanning 74 years to uncover historical trends and generate insights for future competitions. Using advanced data engineering tools and techniques, the project employs Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) methodologies to process and analyze data related to drivers and constructors. The goal is to identify factors contributing to race outcomes and provide a comprehensive analysis that can inform future strategies.
## Objectives

- Analyze historical and present F1 data: Enable profound analysis of 74 years of F1 data to identify trends and patterns.
- Identify dominant status factors: Determine which statuses (e.g., Finished, Retired, Disqualified) are most influential in affecting race outcomes.
- Visualize insights: Create dynamic visualizations using Tableau to depict the most dominant statuses and their counts for each race.
## Key Features

- ETL Pipeline: Comprehensive ETL processes to extract, transform, and load F1 data for analysis.
- Dynamic Analysis: Identifies and visualizes the most dominant status for each race dynamically.
- Historical Trends: Provides insights into the factors influencing race outcomes, including pit stops, lap times, team and driver performance.
